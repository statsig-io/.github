# Welcome to Statsig

Make data-driven product decisions with the most trusted feature management, analytics and experimentation platform. With the most advanced stats engine, you can understand how every product investment is performing. Take control of development costs by winding down things that aren’t working and doubling down on those that are.

## What is Statsig?

Statsig is an all-in-one Feature Management, Analytics and Experimentation platform that enables Product, Engineering, and Data Science teams to control feature launches, measure the impact of each change that ships, and run sophisticated experiments with the most powerful stats-engine in the world.

Statsig can work across any sample size (B2B or B2C); between any stack (frontend, backend, ranking, infra); across any platform (mobile, desktop, web, IOT); at any scale (startups to large enterprises).
